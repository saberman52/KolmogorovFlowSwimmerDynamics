# KolmogorovFlowSwimmerDynamics
Code for calculating the steady-state distributions of noisy swimmers in a Kolmogorov flow.
Included is code for calculating the steady-state probability distribution of an ellipsoidal swimmer with rotational diffusion in a 2D laminar Kolmogorov flow, given the swimming speed, shape parameter, and rotational diffusivity of the swimmer.
In addition, there is code implementing the calculations of the averaging principle.
These functions average the noise-induced drift and diffusivity in phase space over the deterministic trajectories of the swimmer.
The averaged drift and diffusivities are then used to reconstruct the swimmer phase-space density in the weak-noise limit.
